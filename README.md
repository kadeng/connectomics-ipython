connectomics-ipython
====================

These are some IPython Notebooks to get started with the [Connectomic Challenge at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectomics).

The code shows how to download and import the datasets and does a few
pre-processing steps such as determining signaling distance matrices.

The most important part is probably the spike detector, and the subsequent
visualization of possible causal influences on neuron spike probabilities.

I conclude with a short draft for formulas of a Bayesian Model.

Also included in this set of IPython Notebooks is example code of how to
create and embed HTML 5 animations in IPython Notebooks using Matplotlib
and FFMPEG.
